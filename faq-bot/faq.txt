If a databricks backup fails, then go to the log analytics workspace and under logs get the rows from the table DatabricksBackup_CL.

----- NEW ------
If a 403 Forbidden as status code is received, and the response body is “Blocked”, it means the WAF is blocking the request. 
Logs are enabled and stored in the shared log analytics workspace, which means all logs are stored and are searchable.
Using the following query in the log analytics workspace will show all blocked requests:
AzureDiagnostics 
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.CDN" and Category == "FrontDoorWebApplicationFirewallLog" 
| where action_s == "Block"
More conditions such as IP can be added by adding a new line and adding
| where clientIP_s == “{insert_ip_here}”
 will show all blocked requests from a single IP.

----- NEW ------
Login failed for user '<token-identified principal>
This is seen in various scenarios such as when attempts are made to rename function apps
